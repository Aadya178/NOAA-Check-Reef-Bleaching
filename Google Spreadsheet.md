The dataset has been analyzed using Google Spreadsheets.

The following analyses have been performed:

> The data was initially randomly arranged. It was first sorted by `Year` (Ascending) then by `Ocean` (Ascending) and lastly by `Bleaching` (Descending) to give a better view.
> 
> The column `Ocean` (column C) has been label encoded:
> 0 Arabian Gulf
> 1 Atlantic
> 2 Indian
> 3 Pacific
> 4 Red Sea
> 
> In the column `Year`, alternate years have been highlighted to provide clarity.
> 
> Colour scale conditional formatting has been applied to the column `Depth` from shallowest depth (white) to deepest depth (deep yellow).
> 
> In columns `Human Impact`,	`Siltation`,	`Dynamite`,	`Poison`,	`Sewage`,	`Industrial`	and `Commercial`, the feature value `'high'` has been highlighted to show when which of the factors was playing a major role in coral reef bleaching.
> 
> The column `Commercial` (column N) has been label encoded for Pie chart creation:
> 0 none
> 1 low
> 2 moderate
> 3 high

The following tables and charts have been created:

> 1. Human Impact on reef bleaching over the years through its distribution and what the results say
> 
> 2. Impact of Siltation on reef bleaching and its significance in the form of a table and chart
> 
> 3. Dynamite distribution as a function of Ocean; what is the impact of Dynamite in each Ocean
> 
> 4. Visualization of the different intensity levels of Poison over the Years
> 
> 5. Sewage distribution percentage in the data in the form of table and chart
> 
> 6. Industrial impact over the Years, what the visualization tells and a deeper analysis using R^2 for different levels of impact
> 
> 7. Contribution of different levels of Commercial impact depicted using a chart
