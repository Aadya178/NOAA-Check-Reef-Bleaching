The dataset has been [analyzed using Google Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17YlEJlnEoazerE2NNmyAAR1lho-Es6ZeFY7kFdYt5Cg/edit#gid=2104828298).

The following [analyses](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17YlEJlnEoazerE2NNmyAAR1lho-Es6ZeFY7kFdYt5Cg/edit#gid=2104828298) have been performed:

> 1. The data was initially randomly arranged. It was first sorted by `Year` (Ascending) then by `Ocean` (Ascending) and lastly by `Bleaching` (Descending) to give a better view.
> 
> 2. The column `Bleaching` (column B) has been label encoded:
> 
> 0 No
> 
> 1 Yes
> 
> 3. The column `Ocean` (column D) has been label encoded:
> 
> 0 Arabian Gulf
> 
> 1 Atlantic
> 
> 2 Indian
> 
> 3 Pacific
> 
> 4 Red Sea
> 
> 4. In the column `Year`, alternate years have been highlighted to provide clarity.
> 
> 5. Colour scale conditional formatting has been applied to the column `Depth` from shallowest depth (white) to deepest depth (deep yellow).
> 
> 6. In columns `Human Impact`,	`Siltation`,	`Dynamite`,	`Poison`,	`Sewage`,	`Industrial`	and `Commercial`, the feature value `'high'` has been highlighted to show when which of the factors was playing a major role in coral reef bleaching.
> 
> 7. The column `Commercial` (column O) has been label encoded for Pie chart creation:
> 0 none
> 1 low
> 2 moderate
> 3 high


The following tables and charts have been created:
